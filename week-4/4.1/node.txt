```

- Exploring package.json



{
  "name": "4.1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}














- Writing some code

```jsx
let firstName = "Harkirat Singh"
console.log(firstName)
```

- Run the code

```jsx
node index.js
```

- Add a `script` in `package.json`

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
```

- Run `npm run start`
